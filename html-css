I'd recommend focusing on these three core technologies first, as they form the foundation of frontend web development. As you progress, you can then explore frontend frameworks and libraries like React, Vue.js, or Angular, which build on these fundamentals.
In terms of learning approach, I suggest:

Start with tutorials and online courses to build the basics
Practice by building small projects and websites
Join online communities (e.g. Reddit /r/learnprogramming) to ask questions and get feedback
Consider a structured learning path like FreeCodeCamp or The Odin Project

The key is to keep practicing, experimenting, and building things. Web development is very hands-on, so the more you code, the faster you'll progress.
